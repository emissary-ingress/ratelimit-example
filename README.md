# Ratelimit-Example

This repository implements the bare-bones plumbing for a demo RateLimit Service. The implementation is not production ready and only for demo and documentation purposes. It is based on the Emissary-ingress docs found here: <https://www.getambassador.io/docs/emissary/latest/howtos/rate-limiting-tutorial/>

Please see [DEVELOPING.md](/DEVELOPING.md) for instructions on using the demo services.

**IMPORTANT** - This is just a demo implementation and does not provide a Production ready implementation. It is up to users of Emissary-ingress to implement their own logic that fits their use case.
